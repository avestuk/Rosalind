# Need to figure out how many positive integers you have. Can simply count down to 0
# Could use this to also figure out how many place holders the list needs
# Begin creating lists by checking if an integer has already been in a position. I think that each int can be in a position n - 1 times
# Create a cache to check against then check each position
